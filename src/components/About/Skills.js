        At the Faculty, I've managed to acquire lots of IT skills. My first
        passion was building a desktop computers,<br></br>
        where my love for IT is born. During my education, I had a chance to
        acquire networking and web developing skills.<br></br>
        I've started with the basics of HTML and CSS, and later on encountering
        PHP and Javascript.<br></br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I'm mainly working with ReactJS for front-end development and
        NodeJS for back-end development.<br></br>
        Worked on many projects at the Faculty and outside of it.{" "}

        Also I would like to point out that I like working with other people.
